In an era of escalating mobility, informed relocation decisions are imperative. This project
pioneers the integration of big data analytics, machine learning, and predictive modelling
to enhance the decision-making process. Crucial factors such as cost of living, employment
opportunities, state tax implications, and climate are systematically analysed. Datasets
from diverse sources undergo thorough cleaning and preprocessing, resulting in a unified
dataset. The methodology includes normalization, weighting, and the creation of a
predictive foundation using machine learning models. An interactive dashboard,
developed with Dash, visualizes data dynamically. This paper contributes to the discourse
on data-driven decision-making in relocations, emphasizing ethical considerations and
transparency. The innovative approach showcased in this project has the potential to
significantly improve the quality of life for individuals and optimize operations for
businesses.
