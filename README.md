# LEVERAGING-BIG-DATA-ANALYTICS-FOR-INFORMED-RELOCATION-DECISION-MAKING

This project addresses this challenge by integrating data analytics, machine learning, and predictive modelling. Key factors such as cost of living, employment opportunities, and state tax implications are systematically analysed.
